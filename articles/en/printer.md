This error message means that you have no more pages left in your quota. Please delete the print job by clicking the X-button.

## How does the quota system work?

* You can save up pages up to a maximum balance of 600 pages
* Grayscale prints count onefold against your quota
* Colored prints count twofold against your quota
* Punching / stitching is free
